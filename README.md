## Tailscale [ðŸ”—][rules-tailscale-base]

[Tailscale][ts] publishes a [current list][list] of their [DERP servers][derp]. A script is included here for importing that list and turning it into a list of IPs that Little Snitch can use to not annoy me.

```
php scripts/derp.php | pbcopy
```

As of this writing, Tailscale is using Amazon AWS (possibly ELB?) to frontend the `controlplane`, which means there's now a larger list of IPs that the client wants to talk to.

```
php scripts/controlplane.php | pbcopy
```

## Tailscale Nets [ðŸ”—][rules-tailscale-nets]

Some netblocks I expect Tailscale to try talking with; you may not necessarily want any or all of these, or as broad as these may be. I assume access control happens elsewhere.
